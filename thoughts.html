            <h3>week 1: cybernetics</h3>
            <div class="thoughts-para">
                <p><a href="https://logicmag.io/care/where-deer-stroll-peacefully-past-computers/">"Where Deer Stroll Pacefully Past Computers"</a> the editor's note for the <i>Logic</i> issue "Care", highlights the existing tension within technology today: that advances in technological systems and products cannot function as absolute solutions to our societal ills. While technology has become more essential than ever -- Amazon envelopes our shopping habits and work schedules, Zoom is a rote digital gathering space -- our conditioned reliance on technology comes at the expense of recognizing how technology can be appropriated for harm in surveillance and oppression. Most importantly, as evinced by the COVID-19 pandemic, technology cannot care for other people; a seamless, frictionless world driven by tech ignores the very humanity behind technological maintenence and life itself. Essential workers, server maintenance workers, and community care are able to navigate a world built on social relations to realize alternative futures. Technology is but part of the future; people are always relying on and looking out for the care of others.</p>
                <p><a href="https://monoskop.org/images/2/25/Reichardt_Jasia_ed_Cybernetic_Serendipidity_The_Computer_and_the_Arts.pdf">"Computer Poems,"</a> a chapter from Cybernetic Serendipity: The Computer and the Arts, showcases several examples of computer-generated poems. Each example is accompanied by a short description of the design process and evaluation of the end poem. The process usually involves an initial word or character bank, from which the computer is prompted to reference and arrange in a general schema of a narrative or poem. Many of these poems have an air of incomprehensibility or slight strangeness, whether that be in jumbled characters or word choice. And yet this format can actually further engage the reader, who must scrutinize to form their own meaning from the entropy. There is a distinct stylistic affect unique to these computer poems; Jean A. Baudot acknowledges that humans are "essentially opposed to randomness," making our interactions with the randomness of computer text all the more invigorating. Rather than being "errors" in definition, the quirks of computer poems are essential to the form.</p>
                <p>In <a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools">"The Poetry of Tools,"</a> Mindy Seu surveys a collection of computer art within the context of technology as a language itself. Seu argues that the pervasive contemporary perspective on technology relegate it to a neutral, utilitarian interface. Through the collection of digital poems and artwork, Seu encourages the reader to think of their physical gestures and digital interactions, to feel the texture of glitches, and interrogate what it means to read an interface.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>In "The Poetry of Tools", Seu mentions that today's society rarely considers the digital interface. The interface is (mistakenly) regarded as a neutral screen through which we must navigate to obtain a specific endgoal or product. In "Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers", the editor notes that technology is not necessarily neutral or an ultimate positive. What are some examples of oppressive digital interfaces that you've encountered, if any?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The most traditional computer setup involves a QWERTY keyboard, a single rectangular screen, and a trackpad or 3-button mouse. Have you ever experienced any discomfort, physically or mentally, using these tools? What are the benefits/limitations? Have you seen any alternatives to this traditional setup?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>What is your opinion on computer-generated art and the subsequent (inevitable?) monetization practices behind it? For example, Crypko uses neural networks to generate images of anime girls, which are able to be bought and sold using Ethereum. Do you think such a practice is essentially equivalent to the traditional fine art market, or is there a different dimension?</p>

            <h3>week 3: radical digital care</h3>
            <div class="thoughts-para">
                <p>This week's texts centered around the idea of digital care, itself a term still coming into being within the popular lexicon and consciousness. What does digital care look like, especially when society has become so conditioned to cynical, unfeeling technology?</p>
                <p><a href="https://cloud9.support/">Cloud 9</a> (Collective Love On Ur Desktop) is a website that challenges the stark display of a standardized webpage. It emphasizes the collaborative effort behind the website itself and draws the viewer to mutual aid resources, community calendars, and other ways to get involved with those disadvantaged by the coronavirus pandemic. The "outside world" is wholly visible; Cloud 9 recognizes itself as a digital portal, the connective tissue necessary for a more compassionate world.</p>
                <p><a href="https://virtualcarelab.com/">The Virtual Care Lab</a> also takes a similar approach toward care. Instead of acting as an escapist virtual tunnel, the Virtual Care Lab organizes virtual field trips around the internet, and encourages people to imagine alternative formats of remote presence. In doing so, the Virtual Care Lab prompts people to both think about their physicality with fluidity, opening themselves up to myriad social potential.</p>
                <p>Diana Nucera embodies the persona of <a href="https://vimeo.com/354276284">Mother Cyborg</a>, stressing the connection between teaching and mothering. Mothering not just as caring for her community, but in the familial familiarity she uses to understand and pinpoint exact issues people have with technology (and the lack of it) in Detroit. For her, digital justice isn't just about tech literacy; it's about incorporating tech into daily spheres of interaction to imagine new experiences and modes. For example, she organizes workshop events where members of the public can come to articulate their own awkwardness around tech. In a community setting, attendees can learn to send a text, or break open and assemble a computer -- activities that help to demystify the machine.</p>
                <p>Digital justice is about providing people with access to and spaces for technology.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>What are some experiences you've had that you'd term "digital care"? Why?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Have you ever felt like a certain space was digitally hostile? Why?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If, as Mother Cyborg says, digital justice is about collective care, access, and space, how have you been attuned to or alienated from this emphasis on community?</p>

            <h3>week 4: cyberfeminism</h3>
            <div class="thoughts-para">
                <p>In reading <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3">"The Numbers Don't Speak for Themselves,"</a> a chapter from <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/"><i>Data Feminism</i></a>, I was particularly moved by the acknowledgement that data is not some concrete, immalleable representation of reality. Rather, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein emphasize that data can be manipulated and downright misrepresentational, and that it is not the dry numbers and statistics that matter most, but ultimately the contextualization of the data. I found this feminist emphasis on context to be the very antithesis of how data is reported on in Western mainstream media. For example, reporting on the emissions of individual countries often attempts to blame China for global warming, as China is one of the leading countries in producing emissions. However, when accounting for China's population of 1.4 billion people, status as a country where much of the developed First World exports its labor and production to, and reputation for spearheading green environmental policies, China's per capita rate of emissions is much lower than that of Western countries like the United States. And again, this refusal to contextualize data is never done in a bumbling, ignorant way; Western imperialism necessitates a rigid, patriarchal (mis)analysis of data to sustain itself and manufacture consent for war.</p>

                <p>Mindy Seu's <a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/">Cyberfeminism Index</a> is an index of writings on cyberfeminism. While the site seems rather utilitarian in its minimal design as a long list of sans-serif links, simple directional drop-down menu, and download table, I found the site to be welcoming in how no-nonsense it was in assessing these writings. I was reminded of my own experience with finding research online as a college student; it's a lot of jumping through authorization portals and academic journal paywalls. By clicking on links in the Cyberfeminism Index, you can add the texts to your download table, then download them for immediate perusal -- no filtering or additional clicking or deadend research required.
                </p>

                <p>Morehshin Allahyari's website <a href="https://archive.shewhoseestheunknown.com/about">She Who Sees The Unknown: The Archive</a> presents an open archive of Arabic and Persian manuscripts unaffiliated with any institutions. I could see how Allahyari attempted to treat this as an alternative to Western open source archives that, while they say open source, still selectively choose who can access their resources. I found the addition of clicking on body parts to access the various manuscripts a reflective experience; manuscripts as tied to culture and the making of people. I appreciated how there was always context given to the manuscript downloads, and that this context was available in multiple language tabs. (As opposed to traditional digital archiving seen on university library websites, where there is no context and you must rely on the abstracts of the linked text.) Thre were also purposeful navigational quirks designed to interrupt the seamless flow, at least for me, who is unable to read Arabic, an experience that is easily translatable to people who cannot speak the English necessary to access the majority of Western open source archives. When clicking on the head, you are ultimately entering to another page with some text, and image of an Arabic manuscript, and a back button, which, when clicked on, does not take you back a page but instead displays red text.</p>

                        <p>When you see charts, graphs, statistics, or any sort of data cited in news articles, how do you perceive said data? Do you look up the context, provenance, and motivations? How has your relationship to news and data contextualization changed, if at all?</p>

            <h3>week 4: consentful tech</h3>
            <div class="thoughts-para">
                <p>Tega Brain and Sam Lavigne's website <a href="https://neworgans.net/">The New Organs</a> solicits and archives accounts of people's experiences living under surveillance capitalism. These accounts are arranged as black-and-white gifs on a grid, with each gif preloading with the image of an ear. The full gifs include text overlaid on top of stock footage and images relating to the account. The website has a certain cheeky personality, as displayed by the rote smiles of chose stock footage and the whispery voiceover of the introduction video, that is underscored by an ominous awareness of just how invisible yet omnipresent internet data corporations are in our lives.</p>
                <p>In the <a href="http://www.consentfultech.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Building-Consentful-Tech.pdf">Building Consentful Tech Zine</a>, Una Lee and Dan Toliver define the digital body as scattered throughout and controlled by the servers of the internet. To imagine a more just and equitable future, Lee and Toliver emphasize the need for consentful technologies -- in which consent underlies everything from data storage to user interaction -- to reclaim agency over our digital bodies.</p>
                <p><a href="https://togethernet.herokuapp.com/">Togethernet</a> is a peer-to-peer messaging platform that does not store user personal information on servers. Users are familiarized with their respective rooms and its community. Users can navigate the room with their avatars using the arrow keys. A message is placed at the avatar position, and users must move their avatars to an adjacent position to read the message. Leaving the platform causes Togethernet to recognize the user as a new person. Messages are not archivable unless a whole community consents to storing them for personal reference, otherwise, when the last person of a community leaves the platform, the chat history is erased.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>How often do you worry about your digital body and privacy, if at all? Is it an omnipresent worry, or does it only arise when you encounter, say, targeted ads or password breaches? Have your feelings (or even just simple awareness) about your digital body changed with age? How?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>While texts like Building Consentful Tech state that our digital bodies are ultimately beholden to data acquisition and storage, how do you approach presenting your digital body online? Are there certain precautions you take to maintain some sense of control? Do you think this works? Have you observed any failures of digital consent among other people online?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>What do you want to see happen in tech to make a more equitable, just, and consentful digital landscape?</p>

            <h3>week 7: ?nft?</h3>
            <div class="thoughts-para">
                <p>From my understanding, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">NFTs</a> -- non-fungible tokens -- can be anything digital. Unlike cryptocurrency, a single NFT is unique and cannot be traded as a replacement equivalent. In order to obtain this certificate of legitimacy, NFTs (and digital currency) are minted on the blockchain, which requires computers to solve proof of work puzzles, proving the amount of energy expended to mint. However, these puzzles are designed to get increasingly more difficult over time, as more computers are mining for the same relative rate of new coins. Now we have entire server warehouses dedicated to mining, using up the same amount of electricity within a day as a typical American household uses within an entire year -- all with no regulatory measures or oversight in place.</p>
                <p>As a follower of the artist scene on Twitter, it's been quite demoralizing to see favorite artists with large followings attempt to justify their ventures into cryptocurrency and NFT production. I personally believe that there can be no justification for the <a href="https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3">environmental impact of NFTs</a>, which is 100% unnecessary. Many proponents of NFT attempt to compare the environmental impact to the servers of YouTube or other online social platforms, but per capita, the electricity usage is much lower and these platforms actually provide a service to millions of people. Unlike NFTs.</p>
                <p>The rapid popularity of NFTs among collectors shows that they don't really care about artists because if they did, they would've been comissioning artists and supporting artists beforehand. The frenzy to buy up the latest NFT, regardless of the context or perceived artistic merit, exposes how collectors only value art as a symbol of exclusivity and scarcity. It is capitalism distilled to its most pernicious qualities -- art for no sake but asset ownership.</p>
                <p>NFTs have never been about supporting artists; artists online have expressed distress at their artwork being minted and listed on NFT sites by other people, artists are pressured to join NFT schemes out of fear of losing out or having their work stolen. It's not about verifying the artist, because then why do we have miners stealing work from other artists to mine and post on Foundation? This doesn't foster creativity and artist livelihoods, nor does it promote the integration of art in daily life. NFTs only enforce the desolate idea that art is only valid based on some symbolic digital token of monetary worth and forests destroyed, discouraging people from interpreting artwork or even practicing art on their own terms. NFTs are a harassment technique, NFTs construct art as only being able to exist as an input and output, as a token of value for investment (and even this is questionable, given the wild fluctuation of cryptocurrency). It's the worst practices of the fine art market magnified, but without any sort of utility or physical meaning or interest in archiving history. Blockchains don't even store the .jpg or .mp4 files; they just store a link to said file. If that link disappears, then the speculative value immediately dissipates. A bit like Wall Street, with obscenely priced non-material things and the rich finding increasingly ridiculous ways to manipulate money for profit.</p>

            <div class="thoughts-para">
                <p>The Google Creative Lab project I chose to investigate was <a href="https://www.billtjonesai.com/">Body, Movement, Language: AI Sketches with Bill T. Jones</a>. This is a project some classmates were able to experience in class, but I had not yet gotten the chance to personally demo it. This project maps a point on each of the user's wrists. Spoken word shows up on screen, and the user can manipulate the text's size and orientation with their wrist points. Previously, my only understanding of words as physical objects manifested in the form of artistic text sculptures and the like. This project really opened up my perspective in getting me to think of what physicality and user-driven interaction in an alternate dimension could look like.</p>
                <p><a href="https://duoskin.media.mit.edu/">Duo Skin</a>, Cindy Hsin-Liu Kao's project in the <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/export/en/human-unlimited/">human (un)limited</a> Group Exhibition, physically meets gold foil with skin, creating a new touch device on the human body for interfacing with technology. I find this revelation at melding technology with the human body interesting, especially considering for disabled people, harmony (or disharmony) has been a daily part of their lives.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Are you generally optimistic, or are you generally pessimistic about the ongoing advent of machine learning? Why? Does "AI" hold different connotations for you compared to "machine learning"?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A lot of popular discourse circulates around the worry of humans becoming /too/ enmeshed with machines, fearing a dehumanization or alienation from some sort of core humanity. However, technology has often been a necessary part of some people's daily lives; for example, people with disabilities use technology integrated with their bodies on the regular. Can you think of any specific examples of where technology might already be integrated with our bodies? What are the ethical concerns (if you have any) of big tech leading efforts into patenting, licensing, and researching AI and machine learning?</p>
