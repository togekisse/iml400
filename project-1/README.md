[Cybernetic Garden](http://togekisse.github.io/iml400/project-1) is an interactive web page inspired by the poem All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace by by Richard Brautigan.

### Description

This website plays on the idea of a community garden -- computer desks replace individual plots of land. I solicited these photos from friends, with the idea of us still being connected via our computers despite physical distance. With the context of a community garden, we transform the narrative of individualized disparate screens into a new display of interconnectedness and community.
